# Introduction and Motivation 
This guide will describe to how to use a Raspberry Pi as a cryptocurrency miner.  The Pi will have a miniature LCD display attached that will have various mining information shown.

Please note that mining with a Raspberry Pi alone (without having additionally systems set up through a pool as we do) will likely never result in any profits. This is first and foremost an educational project.
