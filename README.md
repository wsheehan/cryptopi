# Introduction and Motivation 
This guide will describe to how to use a Raspberry Pi as a cryptocurrency miner.  The Pi will have a miniature LCD display attached that will have various mining information shown.  Additionally, readers will learn how to set up a cryptocurrency pool on their Pi that could then be connected to via any device. The final product can be seen below: 

**Insert finished product here**

Please note that mining with a Raspberry Pi alone (without having additionally systems set up through a pool as we do) will likely never result in any profits. This is first and foremost an educational project. 

So with that in mind let's get started! 

# Materials and Costs 
**Raspberry Pi**

Clearly the most vital part of this project is the Raspberry Pi. We recommend purchasing the latest model Pi off of the Adaruit website. You can prucahse the model we used, Rapsberry Pi 3 - Model B, [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055).

Cost: $39.95 + Shipping

**Micro SD Card**

Don't be tempted to get a small 4GB or 8GB like we originally did. Synchronizing the blockchain will take a signifigant amount of memory. Go for a 16GB or 32GB if you wish to mine several cryptocurrencies. Eventually we went with [this](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/sandisk-pixtor-advanced-32gb-microsdhc-uhs-i-memory-card-red-gold/7801066.p?skuId=7801066&extStoreId=&ref=212&loc=1&ksid=cfee5b1a-3e22-4387-b064-eefd78af148e&ksprof_id=14&ksaffcode=pg174626&ksdevice=c&lsft=ref:212,loc:2) Sandisk card. 

Cost: $29.99

**LCD Display**

Not necessary but definitely a very cool addition to the project is the Adafruit Blue & White 16x2 LCD + Keypad kit. Snag it on amazon prime [here](https://www.amazon.com/ADAFRUIT-INDUSTRIES-1115-KEYPAD-RASPBERRY/dp/B00DK2A1KE/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid=1495047907&sr=8-14&keywords=adafruit+lcd+display).

Cost: $19.91

**Total Costs**
~$100.00 

# Raspberry Pi Configuration 
The first step in configuring your Raspberry Pi is to hook it up to an external monitor and keyboard. Boot up the Pi and connect to your wifi hotspot (or ethernet). Obtain the IP address. Go into the ifconfig and make sure to parition the micro SD card to use the entire memory. You will also want to go ahead and enable SSH and I2C while you are in the ifconfig. If this is your first time configuring a Raspberry Pi we recommend you follow this [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-2-first-time-configuration/overview) by Adafruit.  

With this complete you are all set to SSH into your Pi and get to work. 

# Installing the LCD Display 

If you decide to forego purchasing the LCD display skip this section. Otherwise put your solder hat on and getting ready to spend the next hour or so soldering.
