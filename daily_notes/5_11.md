# May 11

* The bytecoin compilation catastrophe
  * Large setbacks in compiling bytecoin
  * bytecoin does not roll its own armv7 version therefore the only option is building from source
  * This requires cmake, gcc, and boost all of which I installed
  * A thread error is being called and about a dozen stack overflow answers later I have been unable to compile successfully
  * The error being raised relateds to pthread
  * May have to just scrap bytecoin
