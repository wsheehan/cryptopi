# May 9

* Monero Config
  * Found out that the monero miner we found was not compatible with ARM architecture
  * Found CPU info at `/proc/cpuinfo` it is ARMv7 
  * Downloaded ARMv7 binaries and copied to the pi with `scp -r`
  * Created monero wallet by running `./monero-wallet-cli` executable
  * In order to use wallet cli entire blockchain must be synced
  * Will need to sync on pi overnite, will need to track how much space it is using
